This is my variation of CodeMonkeys KitchenChaos game, it is from the course https://unitycodemonkey.com/kitchenchaoscourse.php

It uses Unity and Visual Studio C#. 

The course is extensive with multiple additional videos in each segment of the main course. I spent months on this learning how unity works and the different unity libraries are used. 
It was a great introduction to game design and Unity as a framework.
